Udacity Fwd  professional web track , first project (Landing Page)

In this project I added navbar in the top of website has 4 section,I create DNavbar function to take information from section like id and section name to add in navbar.
By this function getBoundingClientRect() I used it to show the active section.
This page will smooth in scrolling by using scroll-behavior: smooth; in CSS.
